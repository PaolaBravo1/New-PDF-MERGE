Don't worry about your computer. I only want to use low-performance PCs. Windows tablets are fine too.
Because you will only be using the Google Chrome web browser to find jobs on Upwork and chat with clients.
If you do not share a PC, you can set up New VMware on your PC.

I would like to work with you
Very interested your profile.
I'm a senior Three.js WebGL game developer.
But building 3d models using Unity or Blender, 3d max, Maya, Creo Parametric is rather difficult.
So if you have rich experience in this field, you can make more mon-ey cooperation with me.

Do you have any old PC that cannot be used due to poor performance?
If you have two PC, I can discuss my idea.
And if you have not pc , I'm sorry. I'll find someone else.

Are you working full time as a freelancer on this platform?

Do you know about the Upwork?

Are you working on the Upwork platform now?


https://codefile.io/f/w2VE7YHcbcJfweoSfvKH

Very interesting your profile.
I am a senior full stack developer.
This is my portfolio.
https://spotdomain.netlify.app/

I have earned 5K+ per month on the upwork.
For now I am going to increase my income on the upwork.
So I need your help now.
do you know upwork?

I am going to increase my income on the upwork.
I am willing to work with US clients. However, some clients want to work with the same location(US only) developer.
But now I am from Ukraine.
This is a long-term contract where you get at least $100-300 a month if you agree to it, and after 6 months you get $1000 without working.

I have got more opportunity about the 3D, Because I am a senior three.js developer.


I am also senior full stack senior full stack developer
Working as a freelancer at U-p-work, I have helped many clients around the world.
As you know, American customers are very cool.
Going forward we will only work for US customers.
But now I have some problems. Some clients want to work with same-location (US only) developers.
I'm a senior developer, but I lose a lot of opportunities due to location issues.
Therefore, if you lend a U-pwork account, we will p-ay you 10~20% of your total income.

At first, I can earn 3,000 to 5,000 a month, so I pa-y 300 to 500 each, and after 6 months I will earn more than 10,000 and pa-y back more than 1,000 a month.
If you know of anyone else who can help with my ideas please let me know.
I will p-ay you for that.


When I earned some mo-ney form Upwork, I will withdraw all money your P-ayoneer or P-aypal account.
And then You can send the mon-ey to my account.
How about?



If you create a new Upwork account, authenticate with your information, and let me use the account, I will receive 10-20% of my Upwork income each month.
 
To use your account safely, you must use Anydesk to remotely connect to your computer and keep upwork policy, such as the region of the IP address must be the same as the region of the ld card.
So having more than 2 computers is great. However, if there is only one PC, the working hours are negotiable.
 
Upon completing account verification, you will initially receive $30.
At first, you can earn 1-3k per month on upwork, and if you have a lot of stars and clients on your account, you can earn 5k or more per month.
Of course, I can receive 10-20% of my income every month.




Additionally, I apologize for the late response. I thought I had sent the message earlier, but it seems I only typed it out and forgot to hit the send button. I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused by the delay.






Would you please give me a chance to present my portfolio to you?

If you have any question please let me know.
As you can see I am a senior developer.
But unfortunately some clients want to work only Us developer so If you lend me your account I will get more opportunity and more mo-ney on there.
Please help me,
Of cause it not free.

I'd like to discuss more details.

Hello.
I have a good idea for my new business.
So I'd like to work with you.
Are you available to discuss now?
Best regards.



How does Upwork support know which account I used?
No one can know our contract. (You and me)
Upwork only detects local IP addresses and occasionally wants video verification.(I need help you for the video verification)
And I don't need your Upwork login information. Because I can't use your account on my local (IP change issue, and Video verification issue).
So I'm trying to use my Upwork account remotely (using anydesk or teamview).
I will find and chat with clients for Upwork work using only the Google chorme web browser.
So you don't need a high-Performance PC. Windows tablets are fine too.
Additionally, my friend has been using someone else's Upwork account (US) for the past 2 years and has had no problems.
He made 100k+ on Upwork last year. So he paid 20k+ to his account manager.
I think everything is clear and certain for our contract.
Best Regards.


I have created the account using the VPN, VPS, Proxy etc.
But account was blocked because Upwork was detect the IP address and Upwork doesn't allow multiple accounts for one person.
In one word, can't pass the ID verification on the Upwork.
If you help me I am willing to pay you 20% all my income.
You don't need any work on the Upwork, I will do bid and chat with clients to find for a job.
And Payment problem is very clear.
When I earned some money form Upwork, I will withdraw all money your Payoneer or Paypal account.
And then You can send the money to my address.
I think you can understand my situation.
If you can help me, I will be very happy.
Never mind if you can't help it.
Sorry for being annoying.:pray:
I want to keep friendship.


Hope you are doing well.
As a senior full stack developer, I 'd like discuss about the my new idea or something.
