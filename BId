before starting the task, I want you to give me the range of task and deadline in more details.
The task is not clear to me yet.
When do you wnat to me to send the result?
I'd like you to implement the payment form as you said in the task.
It is better to set payment form in budget to $30/h by hourly. Then It gives me a benefit to my working background.
The project is not so big and the period is short, So It is fine to pay through 3 steps.
In step 1. I will study the task to choose a preliminary solution plan to send the draft.
If the plan is satisfied, Please pay 1/3 of the total pay amount.
In step 2, I will send the most important part of the functions require namely XXXX and YYYYYY.
Then I want you to pay another 1/3 of the total amount.
Please sned the rest of pay amount if all the functions realize satisfy you.
Of course, If you are stisfied to the top point, you can give me some bonus, wouldn't you?
Then I will appreciate your kindness and gentleness.






I'd like you to give me a document for your requirement.
I'll send the discussed stuff on document. If you are not satisfied let me know what it is.
It takes more time to realize all the functions you require.
4 days for a function, 6 days for B function ,... to sum up, It takes 10 days to complete.
To be sure 3 days are enough to make those functions act primarily.
However, it takes more time to finish it perfectly in the qualification you want.
As long as you want to realize perfectly just some of those function, i can make it for shorter time.
I think some of them are not neccessarily required.
I am going to realize this thak as following sequence.
Some functions should be tested after other functions are finished so that I will leave them to complete later on.
I am going to realize the functions in neccssary and high levelsequence.
As the function are finished, I will inform you.
I will inform you the ongoing project situation once a week or twice a week by email or message.
I didn't take time for the project in this week. 
Next week I will make up for lost time.
As working for this function, I found wrong point as follows.



I am glad to meet another nice and gentle customer like you through this project.

Sincerely, excellent programmer.


It is a shame that ther project has gone to the failure.
This project is not only high-level one but also short-preiod one.
Moreover, the time was wasted by several factors.(the requirement was not clear and the requirement was not defined.)
In addition, the working condition was not perfect and a lot of work overlapped each other so I didn't take time to program this project.
i experienced much through this project although this project has not been finished.
I have got much reference how to finish this type of perject in the future.
I hope that I will meet you in pleased task next time.


I like that i can be as creative and independent as I can.
But sometimes I get jobless.
It's not a stable business.
So I always look forward to a long-term relationship with my clients.
This makes me do my best for every project to satisfy them whether it is big or small.
There is no doubt that your server has been infected wiht virus.
May i introduce my colleague, a grahpics designer?
He likes to work wiht us for your project.
Thanks for your payment. Would you make our project complete and leave me a feedback please?
Would you please give me a chance to present my portfolio to you?
Would you share your screen so that I can clearly understand what you need?
let's be on skype until we resolve the issue.

I always feel this way when I complete your projects, eventhough they are not so big!
I like that I can acquire the latest technologies while the prce is not so good.
This project takes much more time and efforts than expected at the beginning.
I just did what i had to do, There is nothing to regret.
I was thinking of another method to build this feature.
We need to confirm the total price  and deadline before starting the project.
I need your cooperation to complete th project in time.
Let me show you my portfolio.
No guts No glory


I have worked with multiple technologies.
I would say that the most comfortable is the project javascript technology.
I have worked with multiple frameworks on the frontend and also Backend.
Regarding the challenge question that you said is, I think what I would like to do is whenever I find my self looking something new at the challenge.
I am starting a project with a new technology that obviously it's related with what I've done, But not actually the same.
I like that challenge to see how it is, and this is how I learned a lot of things, How I learned muliple frameworks.

 Recently, I worked on a project that involved creating a 3D model of a building using Three.js. The project required me to create the model from scratch, including the textures, lighting, and other elements. I used Three.js to create the model and then used WebGL to render it in the browser. I also had to use various libraries such as TweenMax and GSAP for animation purposes. In addition, I had to use various techniques such as raycasting and object picking for user interaction with the 3D model. Overall, it was an interesting experience working with Three.js and I learned a lot about how to create 3D models with it.

 Recently, I worked on a project that involved creating a 3D interactive environment using Three.js and WebGL. The project was to create an interactive virtual tour of a museum, allowing users to explore the museum from the comfort of their own home. I used Three.js to create the 3D environment, and WebGL to render it in the browser. I also used various libraries such as Tween.js and OrbitControls.js to add interactivity and animation to the scene. The project was challenging but ultimately rewarding, as it allowed me to gain a better understanding of how Three.js and WebGL work together to create immersive 3D experiences.

 
I'm a person who loves to overcome challenges and explore innovative solutions, so I would be a good fit for your team.
