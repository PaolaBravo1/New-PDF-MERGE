Cover Letter Sample for a Referred Networking Letter
Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing this letter to express my interest in the International Sales position open at TripleM, Inc. I am very familiar with your products, and would welcome the opportunity to speak with you about how I could help increase your International presence.

My colleague Mr. Zohan  recommended that I should contact you directly about this position. Mr. Zohan and I have worked closely in the industry for many years, and he thought that I would be a good match for TripleM.

My nine years of experienced marketing widgets, not only locally but also internationally have given me an overall knowledge of the business which is directly applicable to your interest in increasing sales abroad.

In my previous position as ‘International Sales Representative’ with UB Industries, I successfully increased our revenue in each of my territories by over 40% within my first year. In the five years I spent at UB, I helped to establish sales bases in an additional seven countries, while I never failed continuing to increase revenue in all.

Please take the time to review my bid as I firmly  believe that I am an excellent candidate for your project, and would very much like the opportunity to meet with you discuss what I have to offer.

I truly appreciate your consideration.
Sincerely Your_name,
(Your Name Here)
