=================== One ======================

As a freelancer I should find out the perfect and suitable job for myself as per my position and then your project was fully matched for me.
Applying for a job if I am not capable of would be a bad idea and can be an obstacle to my smooth career.
So I always choose the right job and think about its pros and cons.

===================  Two  ====================

I know very well that the opportunities don't come every time.
So, whenever we have an opportunity, I do my best to make good use of it.
And I study before I write a proposal and read the job description thoroughly to get the absolute notions about the project.

=================  Three  =======================

Some of the senior developer's skills are nearly identical but I am very comfortable are planing and execution and coperation with the team member.
I believe I’m good at this and mas I am always honest and I am never afraid of doing hard work.
And it is my principle as a web developer to become the best web developer and support the highest quality and customer satisfaction with honesty, constant creation and passion.

===================  Four  ==========================

I believe that loyalty and trust and faith between team members is very important.
As you know, without loyalty and faith within the co-workers, an online company cannot rise.


===================  Five  ========================

Let me know what timeline you are comfortable with and I will work on your timeline.

===================  six  ==========================

I have read your documentation correctly and carefully but I have a few question about your project.
Thanks and Regards,


================= Profile Sample =========================

I believe that people should do things in which they are good at or in which their heart lays.
That’s why I chose freelance web development as my career because I believe I’m good at this and mas I am always honest and I am never afraid of doing hard work.






Some of the senior developer's skills are nearly identical but I am very comfortable are planing and execution and coperation with the team member.
If you hire me you will get to know another trushworthy and talent programmer by choosing me and I will be honored to complete another task perfectly. :)
And I guarantee the qualification of my result and try hard to satisfy for the customer.
