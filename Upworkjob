How does Upwork support know which account I used?
No one can know our contract. (You and me)
Upwork only detects local IP addresses and occasionally wants video verification.(I need help you for the video verification)
And I don't need your Upwork login information. Because I can't use your account on my local (IP change issue, and Video verification issue).
So I'm trying to use my Upwork account remotely (using anydesk or teamview).
I will find and chat with clients for Upwork work using only the Google chorme web browser.
So you don't need a high-Performance PC. Windows tablets are fine too.
Additionally, my friend has been using someone else's Upwork account (US) for the past 2 years and has had no problems.
He made 100k+ on Upwork last year. So he paid 20k+ to his account manager.
I think everything is clear and certain for our contract.
Best Regards.


I have created the account using the VPN, VPS, Proxy etc.
But account was blocked because Upwork was detect the IP address and Upwork doesn't allow multiple accounts for one person.
In one word, can't pass the ID verification on the Upwork.
If you help me I am willing to pay you 20% all my income.
You don't need any work on the Upwork, I will do bid and chat with clients to find for a job.
And Payment problem is very clear.
When I earned some money form Upwork, I will withdraw all money your Payoneer or Paypal account.
And then You can send the money to my address.
I think you can understand my situation.
If you can help me, I will be very happy.
Never mind if you can't help it.
Sorry for being annoying.:pray:
I want to keep friendship.
