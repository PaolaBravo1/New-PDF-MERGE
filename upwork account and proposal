Slack is for the interview?
Seems at the first, you need to setup the interview.
Then, after hiring, you are going to add me on slack.
To be frankly, it is banned to share the contact info before the contract.
So I can't share the email for now. Please make the schedule for the meeting.
Thanks

Hello 
Could you please check my attached Video?
I have finished webGL vidoe renderer project using the React and Three.js, WebGL, Hls.js.



One question: Why you dont mention about the WebRTC, Gstreaming protocal, Socket.io, FFmpeg experience?
Doesn't your project require this experience?

Converting HTML to Svelteket, integrating Supabase login page and Stripe payment integration is a very simple task and I think junior developer can do it too.

======================= IoT React Native Google Map, GPS =====================================

Hello.
Could you please check my Github repo?
https://github.com/IsaiGalarza/IOT-HealthCare-ReactNative

I have checked your project requirements and very interested your job posting.
As you can see my Upwork profile and history I have rich experience in React, Next, ES6+/TypeScript, Jest and Cypress.
I have no experince in GIS but I have rich experience in GPS so I think can help your project successfully. 
Also, an IOT project I created 5 years ago is a collision detection device and phone application that will notify your loved ones on your location when you are out cycling, skiing or even driving.
The device should be attached somewhere that may sense the impact and this triggers your phone to send out an SMS to your designated emergency contact with your location and other health related details like blood type and allergies.

1: User register and log-in APP.
     Registration page will prompt user to key in health-related details and emergency contact.
2: Logged-in user can start session that will trigger pairing of bluetooth device for crash detection and turn on GPS for location sensing.
3: Upon collision, app will start a 10 seconds countdown that user can dismiss if false-alarm triggered by a bump on the road or a minor accident.
4: If user is in a serious accident and is unable to dismiss the countdown, the app will then automatically send out a SMS with information on user's current location and health status to user's pre-set emergency contacts.
That's all.

Keep always extensive knowledge and success with leading efforts in high-quality solutions, implementations.
I am ready to work immediately and I'd like to hear from you about what I should go on.

Cheers
Ysai
